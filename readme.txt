Bringing automatic default responsive images to wordpress.

== Description ==

**If you'd like to contribute to this plugin, please do so on [Github](https://github.com/ResponsiveImagesCG/wp-tevko-responsive-images)**

This plugin works by including 4 additional image sizes for each image upload. This plugin works by including 4 additional image sizes for each image upload. Whenever wordpress outputs the image through the media uploader, or whenever a featured image is generated, those 4 sizes (as well as the initial source and the default wordpress image sizes) will be included in the image tag via the [srcset](http://css-tricks.com/responsive-images-youre-just-changing-resolutions-use-srcset/) attribute.

##Hardcoding in template files

 You can output a responsive image anywhere you'd like by using the following syntax:

`<img src="pathToImage" <?php echo tevkori_get_src_sizes( TheIdOfYourImage, theLargestImageSizeNeeded ); ?> />`

ex.)

`<img src="myimg.png" <?php echo tevkori_get_src_sizes( 11, 'tevkoriMedium-img' ); ?> />`

== Installation ==

1. Upload `plugin-name.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
